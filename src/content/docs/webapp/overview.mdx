# Webapp Overview

The CTF FlagFrenzy web application is the primary interface for users interacting with the platform. It provides an intuitive interface for both competitors and administrators.

## Core Features

- User registration and authentication
- Challenge discovery and submission
- Real-time scoreboard
- Team management
- Administrative controls and monitoring

## Authentication 
The Authentication is made with Azure. For this purpose, a separate app was created in Azure and Svelte contacts this and registers the user with Azure. Important is the .env file in the flagfrenzy-sveltekit folder. This file includes all Azure variables.

## How to run
The whole webapp can be deployed with one Dockercompose this needs two .env files one in the flagfrenzy-sveltekit and one in the root. The one in the root is important for the database and the API. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CTF-FlagFrenzy/webapp.git
cd webapp
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=ep $(which rootlesskit)  ## Rootless Docker
systemctl --user restart docker ## Rootless Docker
docker compose up 
```

To run the webapp in productive mode in another environment you must run following commands:
```bash
cd flagfrenzy-sveltekit
npm install
npm run build
```

If you want to use the Hot Reload feature you need to change the Dockerfile in flagfrenzy-sveltekit:
```dockerfile
FROM node:lts-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

RUN npm install chart.js
RUN npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
RUN npm install @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons @fortawesome/svelte-fontawesome
RUN npx tailwindcss init -p
COPY . .
EXPOSE 80

CMD ["npm", "run", "dev", "--", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
```
