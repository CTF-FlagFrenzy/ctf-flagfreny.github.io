## Learning Path

1. **Fundamentals**: Start with the basics of networking, Linux, and programming
2. **Practice Platforms**: Create accounts on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), or [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/)
3. **Beginner CTFs**: Participate in beginner-friendly competitions like PicoCTF or CTFlearn
4. **Specialization**: Focus on areas that interest you most (web, crypto, RE, etc.)
5. **Team Up**: Join a team or form one with friends to learn collaboratively

## Common CTF Categories

### Web Exploitation
Challenges involving web applications, HTTP requests, cookies, and common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.

### Cryptography
Puzzles related to encryption, decryption, hashing, and encoding schemes.

### Reverse Engineering
Tasks requiring analysis of compiled programs to understand their functionality and find hidden flags.

### Binary Exploitation
Challenges that involve finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in programs to gain unauthorized access or execute code.

### Forensics
Problems that require analysis of data, files, network captures, memory dumps, or disk images to find hidden information.
